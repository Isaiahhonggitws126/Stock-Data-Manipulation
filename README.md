# Stock-Data-Manipulation

# Overview

By utilizing a combination of Python Libraries. Here in this repository I will continually attempt to learn more about importing and manipulating financial data by using the Pandas framework. 

This project is a work in progress and will continually be updated as time goes on. I am currently learning from the website pythonprogramming.net, which is a fantastic resource to learn about applying Python fundamentals into different areas of focus. Moreso, this website offers projects where we are able to build our own spinoffs from the content provided on this site.
